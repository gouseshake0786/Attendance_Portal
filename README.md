🎯 Project Title: Online Student Attendance Portal
🧩 Description:

A responsive and interactive attendance management portal built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to manage attendance for six daily class periods. Each class period has a dedicated “Mark Attendance” button that automatically activates for 10 minutes during its scheduled time slot (e.g., Class 1 at 9:00 AM, Class 2 at 10:15 AM, etc.), and then disables automatically.

This feature simulates a real-world attendance system where students can mark their attendance only during allowed time frames.

⚙️ Key Features:

⏰ Time-based Attendance System – Buttons automatically enable/disable based on system time.

💡 Dynamic UI Updates – Real-time status changes with color-coded button states.

🔒 Content Protection – Right-click and common shortcut keys disabled to reduce tampering.

🎨 Modern Responsive Design – Grid layout using CSS for clean and user-friendly experience.

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6)

Version Control: Git & GitHub
